Well, so far, I think I have been able to keep my promise to you about updates.  Here's the latest.

I've been up for a couple of hours and I'm working on Chapter 2 of the book ***Learning PAGE***.

Chapter 1 is currently being looked at by the publisher.  We are going back and forth trying to fit my style into theirs and I must say, the process is working well.  I haven't had to give up much.  They seem to be pretty willing to take my thoughts and expectations.  Yes, there is a bit of give and take on both sides, but as I said, it's not too terrible.

Chapter 1 is basically an introduction to **PAGE** itself starting with an overview of the main windows of **PAGE** and then creating a simple project that really doesn't do much, but shows some of the basic steps in creating a GUI with **PAGE**.

Chapter 2 will cover creating projects with multiple windows and creating projects with splash screens.  With any luck, I should have it ready to submit to the publisher on Tuesday September 15 for the first edit.  The actual deadline for Chapter 2 is October 6, so I should be way ahead of schedule.  However, the introduction and preface are both behind schedule.  I wasn't expecting to have to split the introduction into both an introduction and preface.  I figured it would all be one chapter.  Oh well, as the saying goes:

> The best laid plans of mice and men oft go astray

Or as Douglas Adams said:

> The best laid plans of mice often go astray.  Men have nothing to do with it.



Any way, I won't bore you with my current health situation other than to say that things are not going as well as expected, so things are more difficult as I would like.  But like everything I've ever done, I won't let relatively small issues, in the grand scheme of things, keep me from moving forward.



So, until next time; stay safe, healthy, positive and creative!

***Greg***
